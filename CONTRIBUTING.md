Hi! We are very happy that you are interested in contributing to ArmoniK.Api. Before submitting your contribution, please make sure to take a moment and read through the following guide.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a
   build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment
   variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Make sure to do a PR against main

## Release Process

### Release a new version

> Replace <version> with the new version number

1. Install Node.js LTS version (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Install dependencies with `npm ci` (from the root of the project)
3. Create a new branch from main named `chore(release): release <version>` (from the root of the project)
4. Update versions using `npm run update-versions <version>` (from the root of the project)
5. Commit changes with `chore(release): release <version>`
6. Push the branch to the remote repository
7. Create a new pull request from the branch to main
8. Merge the pull request
9. Create a new release named `<version>` using the GitHub interface (be sure to select the main branch and to create a tag)

And _voil√†_! The new version is released and a CI workflow will publish packages to registries.

- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic

- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in

further defined and clarified by project maintainers.
