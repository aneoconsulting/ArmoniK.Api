# Angular

The Angular package is build on top of [protoc-gen-ng package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ngx-grpc/protoc-gen-ng). This tool is used to generate Angular services and messages from `.proto` files.

## Update Angular Package

First, you need to install npm dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, you need to generate Angular services and messages from `.proto` files:

```bash
npm run proto:generate:linux
```

Generated files will be available in `packages/angular` folder.

::alert{type="warning"}
This command is only available on Linux. If you are using Windows, you can use [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/).
::

Finally, you will be able to update `index.ts` file which export services and messages needed by the Angular application. `index.ts` is the entry point of the Angular package.

::alert{type="info"}
Generated Angular services and messages are ignored by Git. They are generated by the CI/CD pipeline when a new release is published but you never need to commit them.
::

If needed, you can verify you `index.ts` file is up to date by running:

```bash
npm run build
```

If there is no error, you are good to go!
