# Releases

## Edge Release Channel

API is landing commits, improvements and bug fixes every day. You can opt-in to the Edge release channel to get the latest features and fixes as soon as they are ready.

After each commit is merged into the `main` branch, packages are built and deployed to registries.

The build and publishing method and quality of edge releases are the same as stable ones. The only difference is that you should often check the GitHub repository for updates. There is a slight change of regressions not being caught during the review process and by the automated tests. Therefore, we internally use this channel to double-check everything before each release.
