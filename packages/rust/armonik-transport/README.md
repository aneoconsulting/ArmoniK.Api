# armonik-transport

Transport layer for the [ArmoniK](https://github.com/aneoconsulting/ArmoniK) Rust client:
configuration parsing, and TLS/mTLS connection setup.

Depend on it when you need the connection layer without generated protobuf types or a
`protoc`/`tonic-prost-build` build step. [`armonik`](../armonik) re-exports all of it, so a client that
wants the services as well needs only that one.

## Publishing

**This crate has to be published before `armonik`.** `armonik` depends on it by `path`, and a `path`
dependency cannot be published: `cargo publish` on `armonik` rewrites it into a version requirement
against the registry, so the version it names must already be there.

```sh
cargo publish -p armonik-transport   # first, and wait for the index to pick it up
cargo publish -p armonik
```
