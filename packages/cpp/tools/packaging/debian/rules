# Architecture-related variables such as DEB_TARGET_MULTIARCH:

# Vendor-related variables such as DEB_VENDOR:
#include /usr/share/dpkg/vendor.mk
# Package-related variables such as DEB_DISTRIBUTION
#include /usr/share/dpkg/pkg-info.mk

# Multiarch package requires library files to be installed to

# dh_auto_configure or dh_auto_install to use $(DEB_HOST_MULTIARCH) .
